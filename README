This template is designed to let you try running BOTH a vite server AND a lambda function server simultaneously.

Open two separate terminals to fire each one up independently...

1. Fire up the lambda function server on port 9000
npm run serve-lambda

2. Fire up the vite process to serve HTML...
npm run serve-vite

3. Open the vite port (4173). Assuming everything works correctly, a link to a path starting with
.netlify/functions/ will get redirected to the lambda function in question!
